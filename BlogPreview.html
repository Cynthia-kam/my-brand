All Eloquent methods that return more than one model result will return instances of the Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Collection class, including results retrieved via the get method or accessed via a relationship. The Eloquent collection object extends Laravel's base collection, so it naturally inherits dozens of methods used to fluently work with the underlying array of Eloquent models. Be sure to review the Laravel collection documentation to learn all about these helpful methods!
All collections also serve as iterators, allowing you to loop over them as if they were simple PHP arrays:
Lorem ipsum dolor, sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Magnam sed aut, adipisci repellendus eligendi assumenda error molestias perferendis. Labore necessitatibus, error ducimus eos dicta culpa ad nulla corrupti deleniti distinctio?
