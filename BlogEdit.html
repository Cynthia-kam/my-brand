        All Eloquent methods that return more than one model result will return instances of the
        Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Collection class, including results retrieved via the get method or
        accessed via a relationship. The Eloquent collection object extends Laravel's base collection, so it
        naturally inherits dozens of methods used to fluently work with the underlying array of Eloquent models.
        Be sure to review the Laravel collection documentation to learn all about these helpful methods!
        All collections also serve as iterators, allowing you to loop over them as if they were simple PHP
        arrays:
        Lorem ipsum dolor, sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Magnam sed aut, adipisci repellendus eligendi
        assumenda error molestias perferendis. Labore necessitatibus, error ducimus eos dicta culpa ad nulla
        corrupti deleniti distinctio?
